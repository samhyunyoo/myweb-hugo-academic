## Course Overview

### Course description

This course is an introduction to the field of data analysis and visualization in sociology. It will guide you how to manage, analyze, and visualize quantitative data from diverse topics in sociology. This course is designed to learn the basic knowledge and usages of statistical software, such as Excel and R, in data wrangling, data analysis, and visualization. Basic computer skills are essential to successfully complete this course, though intermediate or advanced computer skills are preferred.

### Required prerequisite

- CUL2004 Invitation to Sociology or equivalent 
- SOC2002 Social Statistics or equivalent

Otherwise, please contact the instructor before registering.

### Course objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will  
- Understand how to manage, analyze, and interpret quantitative data 
- Have practical knowledge and senses of how to present quantitative data through effective graphs and figures.
- Gain on hands-on skills and experience with R and RStudio (especially tidyverse packages).

## Things to install

* Rstudio Desktop, preview version [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
Installing this will automatically install the latest `R` version `4.1.0`, which we need.

optional, but recommended to install:
* `git` [https://git-scm.com/downloads]()https://git-scm.com/downloads No need for a separate `git` program. We'll just use it from `Rstudio` a bit.
* `latex` [https://www.latex-project.org/get/](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)  Alternatively we can install it straight from `R` using the `tinytex` package.
